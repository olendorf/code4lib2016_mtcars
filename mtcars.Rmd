```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=TRUE}
if(!require("pander"))
{
  install.packages("pander", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/", dependencies = TRUE)
}

library("pander", lib.loc="~/Library/R/3.2/library")
library("kfigr")
kfigr.pre

```

The **_mtcars_** data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models). We'll use this example to explore creating research documents in Knitr. The data is shown below. 

```{r, mtcars-table, anchor="table"}
 car.data <- mtcars[, 1:8]
 set.alignment(row.names = 'left')
 pander(car.data, caption = "The first nine columns of mtcars")
```

Starting off simply, we'll test the relationship between car weight and mileage using regression.


```{r, anchor="table"}
  mtcars.regression1 <- lm(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$wt)
  pander(summary(mtcars.regression1))

```

The results show a statistically significant relationship between mileage and car weight. For every 1000 lbs of weight the mileage drops by `r lm(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$wt)$coefficients[["mtcars$wt"]] * -1` miles per gallon. 

The figure below shows the relationship.

```{r, mileage-chart, echo=FALSE, out.width="400px", anchor="figure" ,fig.cap="An analysis of weight versus mileage.", fig.show='hold'}
  plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, main = "Mileage vs Weight", xlab = "Weight (1000s of pounds)", ylab = "MPG")
  abline(mtcars.regression1, col="blue")
  boxplot(mtcars$mpg, notch=TRUE, main="Distribution of Mileages")

```

As you can see in `r figr('mileage-chart')`, we've also added figure captions and included the **_Kfigr_** package to automatically track, count and link figures and tables.
